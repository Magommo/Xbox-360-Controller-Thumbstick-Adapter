This is the project file of the Xbox 360 Thumbstick Adapter to succesfully adapt the new kind of potentiometers (such as ALPS RKJXV1224) to the old Xbox 360 PCB which used a larger footprint thumbstick (the now deprecated ALPS RKJXP1224).
Other than the PCBs, you'll only need some "Arduino type" header pins.
The filetype is the KiKad one, so you'll probably have to use KiKad to open and modify it, but it's an open-source program, so nothing to worry about.
Use the project as you want, modify it, but make fair use of it (do not start making assembled Adapters and sell them for anything over â‚¬6).
